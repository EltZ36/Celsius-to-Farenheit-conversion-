# Temperature Converter

Requirements: Needs a console to show the text/results, and IDE using Python 3.8 or higher. 

Recommendations: use Repl.it or some other IDE (Pycharm, Visual Studio, etc.) to run the files or the Python 3 IDLE to run it. 
You can find the Python 3 IDLE online and install it from there the website is https://www.python.org/downloads/. 

Notes: There is also an Object Oriented Programming version of this called OOP.py. The temperature convertor using functions & the more common programming style is main.py. 
Do not use the OOP as a template for how to use OOP as this is most likely the incorrect way to do so. The syntax for OOP is of course correct and I did the OOP version to learn more about OOP. 

Warning: I have added exit when the program ends. If you don't want that, you can remove it or replace it with something else. You can import sys and use sys.exit instead.

Current issue: f-strings give off syntax error
